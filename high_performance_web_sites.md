## Make Fewer HTTP Requests
- **Image Maps:**
  allow you to associate multiple URLS with a single image. The destination URL is chosen based on where the user clicks on the image. This allows you to replace multiple HTTP requests with just one.<br/>
- **CSS Sprites:**
  allow you to combine images, but theyâ€™re much more flexible than image maps. Each image is wrapped in a span that has a different class, you specify the distance between each image using background-position property.
  - combined images tend to be smaller than the sum of separate images, resulting from reducing amount of image overhead (color tables, formatting information, etc.) <br/>
- **Inline Images:**
  allows you to include images in your webpage without any additional HTTP requests using data: URL scheme. data: URLs are embedded into the page, so they won't be cached across different pages.<br/>
- **Combined Scripts and Stylesheets:**
  you should modularize your code and write your JavaScript and CSS in external scripts and stylesheet files. In the ideal situation, there would be no more than one script and one stylesheet. Combining your scripts and stylesheets leads to a 38% increase in load time.
